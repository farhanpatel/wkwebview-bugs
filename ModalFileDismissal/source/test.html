    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the "Choose File..." button below</li>
            <li>Choose "Browse..." from the action sheet that is displayed</li>
            <li>When the file browser modal is displayed, either choose "Cancel" in the top-right,
                or select a file</li>
            <li>Upon either of those actions, the file browser modal will be dismissed as well as this application modal that contains the web view</li>
            <li>The expected behavior is just the file browser modal is dismissed and the application modal remains</li>
        </ol>
